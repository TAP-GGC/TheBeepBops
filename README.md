## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to have the participants learn basic coding fundamentals, demonstrate critical thinking, and apply block coding. Using block coding, the participants will control a robot called mBot Mega to navigate an obstacle course by utilizing various sensors equipped on the robot. While programming the mBots for real-world tasks, participants will learn about sensors, 'if' and 'else' statements, and booleans.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop will have participants:

- Program a robot to perform basic movement of going forward and backward and using its onboard sensors to test out obstacle avoidance.
- Participate in a robot competition by racing through a pre-designed track, since participants can add variation to the program like making the mBot move faster/slower, turn more sharply, etc...

* <b>Project Title:</b> Using block coding to teach algorithms that can be used to control a robot
* <b>About:</b> The project will include 3 parts, the block coding, the obstacle course, and the actual mBot itself. We will start by presenting to our audience what coding is, how it works, and how it can be applied to the real world. We will have our participants start by learning the basic concepts of coding. Then, we will teach them how to program with one of the most basic forms of code, block code. This will be done with the program that conveniently comes with mBot called mBlock. After showing a very brief demonstration of what you can do with code, we will have them interact with the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in order for them to learn how to code using algorithms. We will have them start off easy with a very basic goal of being able to make the mBot move in a straight line forward and backward for one cycle. Once that is done, we will move to phase 2 which will introduce some more commands that will have the participants allow the mBot to move freely until an obstacle is detected, triggering the mBot to stop its movement and turn in a different direction to avoid crashing into said obstacle. We will have a cheat sheet with the completed code that works with everything mentioned above and we will guide them step by step in order to reach the final code. After phase 1 and 2 is done, we will move on to the final challange and incorporate the content taught so far by having participants try to navigate through an obstacle course. We will have it premade so that the participants can focus on developing their version of the final code that will be used to traverse the course. After all participants are able to complete the course, if time permits, we will have a bonus phase culminating in a race! The participants can compete against each other's programmed mBot to see who reaches the designated finish area first! The track will be designed to allow collisions between mBots, presenting an even greater challenge! We will have a prize for all those who participated and extra prizes for the winners. 

* <b>Difficulty Level:</b> Beginner
* <b>Target Audience:</b> Middle School Students, College Students
* <b>Duration of Workshop:</b> Short version, for the middle schoolers: 30 minutes
                                Longer version, for college students: 75 minutes
* <b>Needed Materials:</b> Computers/Laptops, Access to the https://ide.makeblock.com/ site, Foam Poster Boards, Scissors, Glue, MBot, Battery for Mbot, USB cable for Mbot connection.
* <b>Learning Outcomes:</b> Our main teaching goal will be introducing people to block coding, explaining if statements and while loops, and applying all the content to the mBot. 
* <b>Your Main Technology</b> Mbot Mega - A smart, remote-controlled robot that can be programmed to perform various maneuvers using its RGB modules and obstacle avoidance, line-following, and crash detection sensors.
* [Technology Ambassador Program](https://tapggc.org/) <b>(TAP)</b> is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description

First, participants will code a robot to go forward and backward in a straight line. Then, it will be coded to detect objects that will trigger the mBot to rotate it's course. And finally, it will navigate through a premade obstacle course. For the tasks mentioned, they will use block coding. Additionally, if there are any advanced participants, we will challenge them to use the line detection sensors to make the bot move around on a line.

* [mBot Mega](https://www.makeblock.com/pages/mbot-mega-smart-remote-control-robot) is a buildable smart remote-control robot developed by Makeblock as an educational tool for children to learn computing and have fun.
* mBot Mega uses mBlock, which is block-based coding similar to Scratch. Similarly to Scratch, you can drag-and-drop coding blocks to develop a sequence that the mBot can follow.
* mBot is also equipped with sensors such as IR obstacle avoidance, line follower, and a crash sensor. These sensors can be used without programming but they can be utilized within code for various purposes.
* We chose this technology because it was simple and easy to understand for anyone who doesn't know what programming is.
