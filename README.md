## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to have the participants learn basic coding fundamentals, demonstrate critical thinking, and apply block coding. Using block coding, the participants will control a robot called mBot Mega to navigate an obstacle course by utilizing various sensors equipped on the robot. While programming the mBots for real-world tasks, participants will learn about sensors, 'if' and 'else' statements, and booleans.

## :page_with_curl: Project Description

First, participants will code a robot to move forward and backward in a straight line. Then, it will be coded to detect objects that will trigger the mBot to rotate its course. And finally, it will navigate through a premade obstacle course. For the tasks mentioned, they will use block coding. Additionally, if there are any advanced participants, we will challenge them to use the line detection sensors to make the bot move around on a line.

* [mBot Mega](https://www.makeblock.com/pages/mbot-mega-smart-remote-control-robot) is a buildable smart remote-control robot developed by Makeblock as an educational tool for children to learn computing and have fun.
* mBot Mega uses mBlock, which is block-based coding similar to Scratch. Similarly to Scratch, you can drag-and-drop coding blocks to develop a sequence that the mBot can follow.
* mBot is also equipped with sensors such as IR obstacle avoidance, line follower, and a crash sensor. These sensors can be used without programming but they can also be utilized within code for various purposes.
* We chose this technology because it was simple and easy to understand for anyone who doesn't know what programming is.
