## :loudspeaker: About
The objective of the workshop is to have the participants learn basic coding skills, demonstrate critical thinking, and apply block coding. The block coding will have the participants control a robot called mBot Mega to navigate an obstacle course by utilizing various sensors equipped on the robot. While programming the mBots for real-world tasks, participants will learn about sensors, 'if' and 'else' statements, and booleans.
<!-- You can look at other TAP projects if you need a better idea of how to describe your workshops objectives -->

This workshop will have participants:

- Program robots to move around through obstacle courses using their onboard sensors for the task of obstacle avoidance.
- Participate in a robot competition through a track designed by us, since participants can add variation to their programs like making the mBot move faster/slower, turn more sharply, etc... .

* <b>Project Title:</b> Using block coding to teach how algorithms can be used to control a robot
* <b>About:</b> The project will include 3 parts, the block coding, the track, and the actual mBot itself. We will start by presenting to our audience what coding is, how it works, and how it can be applied to the real world. We will have our attendees start with learning the basic concepts of coding. Then we will teach them how to use one of the most basic forms of code being block code with the program that comes with mBot conveniently called mBlock. After showing a very brief demonstration of what you can do with code we will have them start programming in order for them to learn how to code with algorithms. We will have them start off easy with a very basic goal that is being able to make the mBot move in a straight line back and forth as a loop. Once that is done we will move to phase 2 which will introduce some more commands that can be executed in the code, and have the participants move the mBot in a circle going around in a controlled pattern. We will have a finished code that works with everything mentioned above and we will guide them step by step in order to reach the final code. After phase 1 and 2 is done we will move on to the final challange and incorporate the obstacle avoidance sensors. We will have a premade obstacle course for the participants to try and complete it. After all participants are able to complete the course if there is time we will have bonus phase as a race! The participants can compete in and see who finishes first! The track will be taken apart down the middle to allow collisions of the mBots! We will have a prize for all those who participated and extra prizes for the winners. 

* <b>Difficulty Level:</b> Beginner

## :page_with_curl: Project Description

First, participants will code a robot to go back and forth in a straight line, then in a circular pattern, and finally through a premade obstacle course. For this, they will use block coding. Lastly, if there are any advanced participants, we will challenge them to use the line detection senors to make the bot move around on a line.

* [mBot Mega](https://www.makeblock.com/pages/mbot-mega-smart-remote-control-robot) is a buildable smart remote-control robot developed by Makeblock as an educational tool for children to learn computing and have fun.
* mBot Mega uses mBlock, which is block-based coding similar to Scratch. Similarly to Scratch, you can drag-and-drop coding blocks to develop a sequence that the mBot can follow.
* mBot is also equipped with sensors such as IR obstacle avoidance, line follower, and a crash sensor. These sensors can be used without programming but they can be utilized within code for various purposes.
* Explain why your team chose this technology for this workshop.
